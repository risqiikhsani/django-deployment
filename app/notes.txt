Here, we used a Docker multi-stage build to reduce the final image size. 
Essentially, builder is a temporary image that's used for building the Python wheels. 
The wheels are then copied over to the final production image and the builder image is discarded.

    You could take the multi-stage build approach a step further and use a single Dockerfile instead of creating two Dockerfiles. 
    Think of the pros and cons of using this approach over two different files.
